The following package has every element required for our CPS406 Software Engineering group project. Our group has selected the topic GoWhere.
GoWhere is a university campus navigation tool that addresses the predicament of students trying to locate their classrooms efficiently. Depending on what a student does or does not know, either the student's current location or the location of the room, the user enters a few essential elements and will be prompted with various options based on location and the easiest way to get to the user's destination.

This package includes: 
* A UML Diagram to visualize the code/design architecture.
* A thorough Product Backlog with user stories, priorities, and efforts. 
* A Test Plan includes a list of tests with test conditions, inputs, and expected outputs and which of them have passed.
* The link to a fully completed Source Code
* A Video that shows our finished GoWhere app product and its functionalities.
